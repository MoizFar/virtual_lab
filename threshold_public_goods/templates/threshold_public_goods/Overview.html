	<b>What will I have to do?</b><br>
	This study consists of simple economic decisions which will be explained in detail later. The study should take no longer than 20 minutes in total.<br><br>

	<b>How much payment will I receive for my participation?</b><br>
	You will be paid 4 USD for completing the study. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to receive additional bonus payments. <br><br>

	<b>How will payment be made?</b><br>
	During the study, we will be trading in tokens. At the end of the study, any tokens you have received from the tasks will be converted to USD using the following conversion rate: <b>1 token = 1 USD.</b><br><br>

	This experiment will continue over the next 21 days. Once all participants complete this study, we will determine your bonus payments based on the decisions made in the tasks. This bonus payment will be made via the Prolific platform.<br><br>

	Finally, please note that this research <u>does not employ deception</u>. This means that the instructions that you are about to read are true and not deceptive. This is regulated by the researchersâ€™ intuitional ethics committees. <br><br>
